# fedkx

This repository is for a small app to allow kxstudio apps, and eventually others, to be downloaded, converted and installed on Fedora.


From where I am viewing, some scum bag has hacked my git repository and I've got some dufus called jamesjoaquin claiming that he made the commits.


I don't know git well enough to edit this hack from my code, but I will take the opportunity to point out
that this is my code, and my own work.

If you are jamesjoaquin then please get in touch to explain why you have hacked my codebase.
